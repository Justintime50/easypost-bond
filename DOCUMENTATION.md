# Withbond Carrier Integration

## Problems

1) Labels are returned as files and not links or data.
2) Labels must be purchased with an internal ID and not something the user would have on hand. This will require a retrieval of the ID or storing it on file
3) You cannot pass a custom ID at time of creation since EasyPost needs to generate the shipment ID. This will require creating a shipment and then updating it afterwards
